        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>Background</h3>
        <p>According to the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), in Santa Barbara, California there are around 100 active oil and gas wells and 1,778 idle wells, which pose environmental and health risks. The Santa Barbara County Grand Jury examined the issue of idle wells and found that the health and environmental risks are not being addressed due to lack of adequate oversight. Since wealthy corporations maintain offshore oil platforms and the number of these operations can change over time based on bureaucratic discussions, the issue of proximity to oil sources for the residents of Santa Barbara County is one that deserves map-based support because of the challenges around accessibility—-to be a public voice, to be involved in discussion, or to provide knowledge.

          We hope to address this issue with our mapplication and showcase Santa Barbara community voices on the challenges around serving as a public voice or trying to do so. Ultimately, we hope to assist Santa Barbara in understanding the community’s reasons for participating in civic engagement (and their experiences in doing so) and the barriers to participating in civic engagement involving oil spills.
        </p>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>Who do we hope to empower?</h3>
        <p>Our project aims to empower the residents of Santa Barbara County, especially community members concerned about local sources of oil pollution and future oil spills. Additionally, because distribution of our survey will be aided by public institutions such as UC Santa Barbara, we want to specifically empower the voices of unhoused or undocumented people who experience difficulties in public spaces and are typically erased in dominant methods of censure surveys.  
        </p>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>Long-term Impact</h3>
        <p>We hope that our project will bring awareness to Santa Barbara residents' experiences with civic engagement surrounding the threat of oil spills in their community. By surveying a diverse array of community members, our mapplication filled with stories from local residents can be used as a mapping archive that gives Santa Barbara residents a space to connect over shared experiences with oil pollution and civic engagement. Our mapplication can highlight the more prevalent problems and spark deeper conversations within the community, which can potentially enact change and hopefully minimize the chaos associated with public participation with this streamlined platform for accessible information and knowledge sharing. Since we are not solving the issue of oil pollution and governmental neglect, we aspire to create access points for understanding the Santa Barbara community—-a necessary step in building solidarity and activism. Our mapplication could be distributed to UC Santa Barbara, especially to students and faculty in the UCSB Environmental Studies Program and the Marine Science Institute, so that they can share their stories (involving their concerns, research, knowledge) with us and learn about local residents' experiences.
        </p>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>How others can use this project in the future</h3>
        <p>By highlighting the stories of the Santa Barbara community, our mapplication serves to support people in various coastal communities affected by oil spills as they are able to share and expand their knowledge on the concerns that impact their communities' collective response. Additionally, our project can make it easier for global communities, who are concerned about their friends, family or even a stranger's proximity to oil pollution sources in Santa Barbara, to gain a deeper understanding of their lived experiences, challenges, and different perspectives surrounding oil pollution. As more local residents contribute to the mapplication through their stories, hopefully future residents will be able to use this mapping archive as a tool to gauge how past and current community members have been involved in civic engagement and the obstacles they overcame or continue to encounter. By reading through community members' stories on our mapplication, as well as adding their own, environmental organizations, other developers, and global communities can utilize our project to implement some ideas or suggestions based on stories shared in the survey.
