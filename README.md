We created our project for Santa Barbara, California to learn about local residents' experiences in civic engagement involving oil spills or the barriers and challenges they have faced in trying to participate in civic engagement. Santa Barbara community members can share their experiences and perspectives in our survey, which will be displayed on our mapplication designed to empower local residents and provide a tool for global coastal communities affected by oil spills to share and expand their knowledge on the concerns that impact their communities collective civic response. In the future, our tool can be used as a mapping archive that gives residents a space to connect over shared experiences with oil pollution and civic engagement.
