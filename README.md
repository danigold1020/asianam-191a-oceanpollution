We are addressing the concerns from the Santa Barbara community and how they participate in civic engagement regarding oil spills by creating a survey and mapplication using google forms, google sheets, and leaflet. Our mapplication serves to support people in various coastal communities affected by oil spills as they are able to share and expand their knowledge on the concerns that impact their communities collective civic response. In the future, our tool can be used as a mapping archive that gives residents a space to connect over shared experiences with oil pollution and civic engagement.
