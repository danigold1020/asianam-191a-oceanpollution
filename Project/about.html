        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>Background</h3>
        <p>According to the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), in Santa Barbara County, there are around 100 active oil and gas wells and 1,778 idle wells, which can still pose environmental and health risks despite not producing oil; if idle wells are not properly maintained, they can leak and release harmful gasses such as carcinogens and methane emissions. The Santa Barbara County Grand Jury examined the issue of idle wells (Guentz 2021) and found that the health and environmental risks are not being addressed due to lack of adequate oversight. As of 2021, wealthy corporations such as  ExxonMobil, Venoco, and Freeport-McMoRan maintain offshore oil platforms along with related entities, such as pipelines, storage facilities, processing plants, and other infrastructure, used to support oil and gas operations (US BOEM). 
            Since the number of these operations can change over time and can be affected by bureaucratic discussions, it is essential that the Santa Barbara community is included in the decision-making process.  When the board of supervisors holds meetings, members of the public specifically have to opt in to be heard. When settlements happen it gives the illusion of the issue being settled, mystifying any existing challenges on the ground for residents of Santa Barbara County. When discussing the future of oil spills, residents should have a place to share opinions and learn about others’ experiences. The issue of proximity to oil for the residents of Santa Barbara County is one that deserves map-based support because of the challenges around accessibility—to be a public voice, to be involved in discussion, or to provide knowledge—that remain). UCSB in particular is a great resource to accessing public opinion given their already established relations with the public.
        </p>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>Objective</h3>
        <p>Our objective is to create a mapplication at the benefit of all county residents, past, present and future. We aim to give a voice to residents who can use our project to share their experiences participating in civic engagement (e.g. public hearings, town hall meetings) and we seek to learn about the barriers/challenges faced by residents who haven’t participated in civic engagement opportunities. Our project aims to visualize the lived experiences of Santa Barbara’s coastal community impacted by the threats of oil spills and how they showcase their feelings through civic engagement. An additional area of concern is accessibility––we want to depict barriers experienced from those that wish to participate in civic engagement but cannot. Our compilation of data may include inquiries about obstacles to civic participation/public hearings that a resident may experience and ask questions that can account for both simple and more detailed responses about the current social and environmental situation. Ultimately, we want to enable a platform for highlighting the stories of Santa Barbara residents and creating a space to facilitate dialogue.   
        </p>
        <h3 id=""subheading2>Long-term Impact</h3>
        <p>In the long term, we hope that our tool is useful as a mapping archive that gives residents a space to connect over shared experiences with oil pollution and promote their civic engagement. While we can't fix the challenges faced by Santa Barbara residents, our mapplication can highlight the more prevalent problems and spark deeper conversations within the community. These conversations may foster debate to help make decisions and hopefully minimize the chaos associated with public participation with this streamlined platform for accessible information and knowledge sharing. Since we are not solving the issue of oil pollution and governmental neglect, we aspire to create access points for understanding one’s own community—a necessary step in building solidarity and activism. Because distribution of our survey will be aided by both public institutions such as UCSB, we want to specifically empower the voices of unhoused or undocumented people who experience difficulties in public spaces  and  are typically erased in dominant methods of censure surveys. By highlighting the stories of the Santa Barbara community, our mapplication serves to support people in various coastal communities affected by oil spills as they are able to share and expand their knowledge on the concerns that impact their communities collective response. Additionally, our project can make it easier for global communities, who are concerned about their friends, family or even a stranger's proximity to oil in Santa Barbara, to gain a better understanding of their lived experiences, challenges, and desires.
