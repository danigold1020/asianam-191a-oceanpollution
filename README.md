# Oil Spills and Civic Engagement: Santa Barbara Community
### By Angelica Alcantar + Danielle Goldwirth + Enyi Emuka
> Oil Spills and Civic Engagement: Santa Barbara Community is a mapplication (map application) project that displays Santa Barbara residents’ stories centered around civic engagement participation surrounding oil spills in their community. Through these stories, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the community’s experiences in civic engagement involving oil spills and the barriers they have faced in trying to participate in civic engagement.

## :ocean:Objective
### What social problem is being addressed?
In Santa Barbara, California there are around 100 active oil and gas wells and 1,778 idle wells, which pose environmental and health risks. The Santa Barbara County Grand Jury examined the issue of idle wells and found that the health and environmental risks are not being addressed due to lack of adequate oversight. Since wealthy corporations maintain offshore oil platforms and the number of these operations can change over time based on bureaucratic discussions, the issue of proximity to oil sources for the residents of Santa Barbara County is one that deserves map-based support because of the challenges around accessibility—-to be a public voice, to be involved in discussion, or to provide knowledge. 

We hope to address this issue with our mapplication and showcase Santa Barbara community voices on the challenges around serving as a public voice or trying to do so. Ultimately, we hope to assist Santa Barbara in understanding the community’s reasons for participating in civic engagement (and their experiences in doing so) and the barriers to participating in civic engagement involving oil spills. 

## :ocean:Who is being empowered?
Our project will empower the residents of Santa Barbara County, especially community members concerned about local sources of oil pollution and future oil spills. Additionally, because distribution of our survey will be aided by public institutions such as UC Santa Barbara, we want to specifically empower the voices of unhoused or undocumented people who experience difficulties in public spaces  and  are typically erased in dominant methods of censure surveys.

## :ocean:What technology was used?
In this project, we used Google Forms to create our community survey and multiple programming languages (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) to create our mapplication. We also used software such as Leaflet and Papaparse to create our map and import our community survey data, as well as Google Sheets and Google Apps Script for geocoding. 

To create the website and mapplication itself, we utilzed 2 main HTML files, 1 CSS file, and 2 Javascript files. Our HTML files were for our Home and About pages. We connected the CSS and Javascript files to these main HTML files to incorporate style elements and our interactive map and slideshow features.

### What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
Since we narrowed our scope to focus only on residents of Santa Barbara County, this smaller, more convenient sample in California may provide stories that don't represent perspectives of other communities dealing with the threat of oil spills. There are a wide variety of stories and experiences regarding oil spills and pollution around the world, so we acknowledge that the current community of focus displays a biased archive of stories regarding civic engagement experiences in Santa Barbara.

### Long-term Impact
We hope that our project will bring awareness to Santa Barbara residents' experiences with civic engagement surrounding the threat of oil spills in their community. By surveying a diverse array of community members, our mapplication filled with stories from local residents can be used as a mapping archive that gives Santa Barbara residents a space to connect over shared experiences with oil pollution and civic engagement. Our mapplication can highlight the more prevalent problems and spark deeper conversations within the community, which can potentially enact change and hopefully minimize the chaos associated with public participation with this streamlined platform for accessible information and knowledge sharing. Since we are not solving the issue of oil pollution and governmental neglect, we aspire to create access points for understanding the Santa Barbara community—-a necessary step in building solidarity and activism. Our mapplication could be distributed to UC Santa Barbara, especially to students and faculty in the UCSB Environmental Studies Program and the Marine Science Institute, so that they can share their stories (involving their concerns, research, knowledge) with us and learn about local residents' experiences. 

### How others can use this project in the future.
By highlighting the stories of the Santa Barbara community, our mapplication serves to support people in various coastal communities affected by oil spills as they are able to share and expand their knowledge on the concerns that impact their communities' collective response. Additionally, our project can make it easier for global communities, who are concerned about their friends, family or even a stranger's proximity to oil pollution sources in Santa Barbara, to gain a deeper understanding of their lived experiences, challenges, and different perspectives surrounding oil pollution. As more local residents contribute to the mapplication through their stories, hopefully future residents will be able to use this mapping archive as a tool to gauge how past and current community members have been involved in civic engagement and the obstacles they overcame or continue to encounter. By reading through community members' stories on our mapplication, as well as adding their own, environmental organizations, other developers, and global communities can utilize our project to implement some ideas or suggestions based on stories shared in the survey.

### Features
1. **Interactive Map**

The Leaflet Map is very interactive for the user. It is centered around UCLA's campus, and the markers are indicative of each student response and where they live. By clicking on a marker, the map will fly to that marker and it will be the only marker highlighted. Furthermore, clicking a marker creates a pop-up displaying the respondent's profile, including Major and Campus Affiliations. The slideshow to the right of the map also changes to that respondent's survey answers, creating a full story for this community member. 

2. **Slideshow**

The Slideshow is also interactive for the user and connects with our map. When you first enter the website, the slideshow displays a welcome message and some basic information about the project. There are also simply instructions on how to navigate the site's Home Page and see student stories. As you click through the slideshow, you will see each respondent's open response survey questions on a different page. Clicking through also results in the map flying to each student's marker and displaying their full profile and story.

3. **Menu Bar + Survey Button**

The menu bar at the top of the mapplication allows for easy navigation between the Home page and About page. It also holds our 'Add Your Story' button, which leads users to the survey we built for this project.

4. **Descriptions**

Underneath our map and slideshow, there are descriptions to the project and UCLA Zero Waste. Along with these descriptions, there are links to find out more about both topics.

5. **About Page**

The About page serves as a place where users can learn more details about the project without taking space away or distracting from the main map feature on the Home page.
