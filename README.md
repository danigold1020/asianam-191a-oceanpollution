# asianam-191a-oceanpollution

We are addressing oil spills in the ocean that affect the health of coastal communities and marine life to empower populations affected by the devastating impacts of oil spills. We may encounter problems with biased data provided by the oil industry that does not fully reveal the damage caused by oil spills so we will incorporate data sourced from organizations that work to reduce ocean pollution.
