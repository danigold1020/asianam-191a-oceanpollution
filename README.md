# Oil Spills and Civic Engagement: Santa Barbara Community
> We created our project for Santa Barbara County in California to learn about local residents' experiences in civic engagement involving oil spills or the barriers and challenges they have faced in trying to participate in civic engagement. Santa Barbara community members can share their experiences and perspectives in our survey conducted through Google Forms, which will be displayed on our mapplication designed to empower local residents and provide a tool for global coastal communities affected by oil spills to learn about factors that may impact their communities' collective civic response. To create our mapplication, we used JavaScript and Leaflet, as well as Google Sheets and Google Apps Script for geocoding. In the future, our tool can be used as 1) a mapping archive that gives Santa Barbara residents an opportunity to connect over their shared experiences with civic engagement surrounding oil pollution and 2) an opportunity for developers to establish a web-based GIS platform for other communities to share their personal experiences to promote social change.

## General Information
- In Santa Barbara County, there are around 100 active oil and gas wells and 1,778 idle wells that pose environmental and health risks.
- The Santa Barbara County Grand Jury found that the risks are not being addressed due to lack of adequate oversight.
- The issue of proximity to oil for the residents of Santa Barbara County is one that deserves map-based support because of the challenges around accessibility.
- It is essential that the Santa Barbara community is included in the decision-making process
- Residents should have a place to share opinions and learn about othersâ€™ experiences.
