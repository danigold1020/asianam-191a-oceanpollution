           <h1>Santa Barbara Community Survey: Oil Spills and Civic Engagement</br></h1>
           <p id="intro">Welcome to our mapplication! Our project aims to uplift Santa Barbara County residents by providing a platform 
                to share stories of their experiences with civic engagement around oil spills and the obstacles they have faced. We welcome you to navigate through our
                map to read the varied stories of Santa Barbara community members or share your own story.</p>

                  <h1>About Our Project</h1>
                    <p>By Angelica Alcantar, Danielle Goldwirth, and Enyi Emuka</p>
                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>
                    In Santa Barbara, California there are around 100 active oil and gas wells and 1,778 idle wells, which pose environmental and health risks. The Santa Barbara County Grand Jury examined the issue of idle wells and found that the health and environmental risks are not being addressed due to lack of adequate oversight. Since wealthy corporations maintain offshore oil platforms and the number of these operations can change over time based on bureaucratic discussions, the issue of proximity to oil sources for the residents of Santa Barbara County is one that deserves map-based support because of the challenges around accessibility—-to be a public voice, to be involved in discussion, or to provide knowledge.

                    We hope to address this issue with our mapplication and showcase Santa Barbara community voices on the challenges around serving as a public voice or trying to do so. Ultimately, we hope to assist Santa Barbara in understanding the community’s reasons for participating in civic engagement (and their experiences in doing so) and the barriers to participating in civic engagement involving oil spills.
                  </p>
          
                  <h2>Long Term Impact</h2>
                  <p>
                    By highlighting the stories of the Santa Barbara community, our mapplication serves to support people in various coastal communities affected by oil spills as they are able to share and expand their knowledge on the concerns that impact their communities' collective response. Additionally, our project can make it easier for global communities, who are concerned about their friends, family or even a stranger's proximity to oil pollution sources in Santa Barbara, to gain a deeper understanding of their lived experiences, challenges, and different perspectives surrounding oil pollution. As more local residents contribute to the mapplication through their stories, hopefully future residents will be able to use this mapping archive as a tool to gauge how past and current community members have been involved in civic engagement and the obstacles they overcame or continue to encounter. By reading through community members' stories on our mapplication, as well as adding their own, environmental organizations, other developers, and global communities can utilize our project to implement some ideas or suggestions based on stories shared in the survey.
