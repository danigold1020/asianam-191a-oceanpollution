We created our project for Santa Barbara County in California to learn about local residents' experiences in civic engagement involving oil spills or the barriers and challenges they have faced in trying to participate in civic engagement. Santa Barbara community members can share their experiences and perspectives in our survey, which will be displayed on our mapplication designed to empower local residents and provide a tool for global coastal communities affected by oil spills to learn about factors that may impact their communities' collective civic response. In the future, our tool can be used as a mapping archive that gives residents an opportunity to connect over their shared experiences with civic engagement surrounding oil pollution.
